Yet Another Django Static Site Generator


## What is this?
This project aims to create a static site generator, similar to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The plan is to create a project that can be used primarily to manage personal blogs that can be hosted on github pages and like, whilst, if needed, can be hosted on a private server to create and manage blogs on that server and/or on github pages.  

## Why another static site generator ????
Well, tbh, it's because I don't know Ruby (as of now). I wanted to customize Jekyll themes, but as a Python user, I thought it would be easier to do it via Jinja like syntax and add themes. Furthermore, as an aspiring Data Scientist, I was really impressed by simple, yet powerful blogs like the one by [Christopher Olah](https://colah.github.io/). That's the gist of it.

## Is it only Django?
Well, I mean, maybe some JS and CSS is definately needed. Will update as the changes come.
